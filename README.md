# dotfiles - _managed by Makefile_

## Managed configuration files

## No longer managed configuration files

### btop++

Not managed since the configuration file can be modified from the UI,
"polluting" the repository

## TODO

- remove lunarvim
- update tmux configuration
- fix autocomplete in lazyvim to show less rubbish
- transition from zathura to [sioyek](https://github.com/ahrm/sioyek/tree/development)
